## Plugins

Considering swithing from oh-my-zsh to something slightly lighter.

- [x] need git branch completion
- [x] need autosuggestions for previously input commands
- [ ] Probably document setting these up
- [ ] Check `~/.zshrc` in
- [x] Look at capslock for inspiration. maybe fork https://github.com/Vonng/Capslock
- [x] Figure out three finger tap
- [ ] Look into more alfred integrations. consider integrating with Dock?
- [x] Figure out LShift Rshift parens
