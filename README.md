# README

Right now this is mostly Mac-specific, but someday soon I will make it more linux-friendly!

## How to

To apply dotfiles from this repo to your computer. This is dangerous and will overwrite people you care about.

```sh
sh ~/dev/dotfiles/apply.sh
# or downdots
```

To copy your local dotfile changes to this dotfiles directory for syncing to and from github.

```sh
sh ~/dev/dotfiles/update.sh
# or updots
```

## Todo

- [ ] Document scripts
- [x] Use shared file list for update,apply, etc
- [ ] Fix Karabiner QQ
- [ ] Script to check for differences

- [x] need autosuggestions for previously input commands
- [ ] Probably document setting these up
- [x] Check `~/.zshrc` in
- [x] Look at capslock for inspiration. maybe fork https://github.com/Vonng/Capslock
- [x] Figure out three finger tap
- [ ] Look into more alfred integrations. consider integrating with Dock?
